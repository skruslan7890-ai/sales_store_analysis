About Dataset
📌 Project Background
A retail store chain tracks daily sales transactions, including order details, customer info, product categories, order times, and order status. The business wants to optimize operations, improve customer experience, and increase profitability using data-driven decisions.

📌 Problem Statement
The company doesn't have a clear idea about:
1. sales performance trends,
2. customer purchasing behavior,
3. product profitability, and
4. operational inefficiencies — affecting revenue growth and customer retention.
Because of these, they are missing chance to ern more, losing customers, and making poor business decisions.

📌 Solution
They need structured reporting and analytics to identify high-performing products, peak purchase times, delivery issues, and customer preferences.
